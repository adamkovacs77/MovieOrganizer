# Movie Organizer Android Application

## 1. Introduction
  - **What?**
    - What is this application about? It is a (still in development) movies and series tracking application created to .help you when you want to watch a movie or a TV show.
  - **Why?**
    - Why did we create this app? We created this app because we wanted to end the movie 'compatibility' problem with our friends, when at least one of them watched the movie we wanted to see already.
    
## 2. Design and implementation
  - **How?**
    - Use cases descriptions ... (firebase etc)
    
## 3. State of the art
  - Other similar apps are listeed in the table below. Basically, all the other apps are doing this job better than ours, but we've had an idea (unimpemented yet), that we didn't see in these apps: movie/tv show 'match' with a friend. Whenever you want to watch a movie with your friends, you will add them to a list and then check if any of them have seen the movie or not. This feature will probably be implemented later.

## 4. Usage
  - The app is pretty easy to use. When you open it you are redirected to the main screen, where you can see the two buttons (My Movies and My Series) which will lead to the list of the movies/tv shows you added.

  </p>

  - Below the Toolbar there is a search field where you can search for your TV shows/movies. After hitting the Search button, a list containing the shows/movies matching your search criteria will show up.

  - Moving on to the "My Movies" or "My Series" section, the movies/tv shows you previously added will show up in those sections and will look like this:

## 5. Conclusions
  - In conclusion, we had to put some effort into this app because we were not familiar with Android Studio (neither with Kotlin). This was our first project in Kotlin, but we enjoyed it, especially using the OMDb API (from which we would've liked to get more data). The toughest part was designing a not so simple UI, which is still a hard task for us.
